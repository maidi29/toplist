  <app-collapsible header="How it works">
    <p>Toplist is a turn-based real-time party game for 4 to 10 players.</p>
    <p>In each round another player is the master and thinks of a topic (or chooses from a selection of example
      topics) to which the players must find an example according to their assigned value on a scale.</p>
    <p>An example question could be "What is the perfect first date activity - from 1 (Horror date) to 10 (Dream date)"</p>
    <p>As soon as all players have submitted an answer, the master starts to reveal them. Then he sorts the answers on the
      scale so, with the aim of guessing the correct order.
      After that, the true values of the players are revealed.
      For each correctly assigned answer the master receives one point and the player who gave the answer also receives one point
      Afterwards, the role of the master
      changes to the next player, whose turn it is to think up a question.</p>
    <p>The game ends as soon as each player has been master as many times as defined in the number of runs at the
      beginning.</p>
